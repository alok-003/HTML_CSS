    <h3>Early Life on Tatooine</h3>
    <p>Anakin Skywalker was born on the desert planet Tatooine to Shmi Skywalker, a slave. His birth was mysterious, as he had no biological father—his mother claimed he was conceived by the Force. From a young age, Anakin showed extraordinary talent, especially with mechanics and pod-racing. Despite being just a boy, he was able to build complex machines, including a fully functioning protocol droid named C-3PO. He won a pod-race that helped free him from slavery when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn discovered him and believed he was the Chosen One—a being prophesied to bring balance to the Force.</p>
    <h3>Jedi Training and Rising Power</h3>
    <p>Anakin was taken to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and trained as a Jedi under Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon's apprentice. Though the Jedi Council was reluctant due to Anakin’s age and emotional attachments, they eventually allowed his training. As a Jedi Padawan, Anakin proved to be powerful, brave, and impulsive. He fought in the Clone Wars, rose quickly through the ranks, and was eventually made a Jedi Knight. However, his deep emotional attachments—especially his secret love and marriage to Padmé Amidala, a senator and former queen—began to cause inner conflict and tension with the Jedi Code.</p>
    <h3>Fall to the Dark Side</h3>
    <p>Anakin's fear of loss—especially the recurring visions of Padmé dying in childbirth—drove him toward desperation. Manipulated by Chancellor Palpatine, who was secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, Anakin was offered a way to save Padmé using the dark side of the Force. Torn between loyalty to the Jedi and his desire to protect his wife, Anakin chose to side with Palpatine. He became Darth Vader, betrayed the Jedi, and helped execute Order 66, leading to the near-extinction of the Jedi Order. In a devastating duel on Mustafar, Anakin was defeated by Obi-Wan and left severely injured and burned.</p>
    <h3>Life as Darth Vader</h3>
    <p>Rescued by Sidious, Anakin was rebuilt with black armor and a life-supporting suit, completing his transformation into the feared Sith Lord Darth Vader. As Vader, he hunted the remaining Jedi and helped the Empire tighten its grip on the galaxy. Though he appeared ruthless and unfeeling, traces of conflict and regret remained buried within him. He believed Padmé had died because of his own actions, which haunted him deeply. Over the next two decades, he became a symbol of terror, enforcing the Emperor’s rule without mercy.</p>
    <h3>Redemption and Death</h3>
    <p>Anakin's redemption came through his son, Luke Skywalker, who believed there was still good in him. During the final confrontation with the Emperor in Return of the Jedi, Luke refused to kill his father and instead appealed to Anakin’s humanity. When Emperor Palpatine tried to kill Luke, Anakin made the ultimate sacrifice—turning against his master to save his son. He threw the Emperor to his death, mortally wounding himself in the process. In his final moments, Anakin was reunited with Luke, redeemed by love and compassion. He died peacefully and became one with the Force, his spirit appearing alongside Obi-Wan and Yoda as a Force ghost.</p>
